# Insert using Query Builder
To persist your object using Easy ORM is very simple. You just need to follow these steps:

```js
Person oussama = new Person("C1234", "Oussama");
EasyOrm
    .buildObject(oussama.class)
    .save(oussama);
```

And it also supports the persistence of your object's relationships, but the relationships must be persisted first.

```js
Car car = new Car("191", "Mercedes", oussama);
EasyOrm
    .buildObject(Car.class)
    .save(car);
```
