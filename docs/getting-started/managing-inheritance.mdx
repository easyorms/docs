# Managing Inheritance

We don't need to do anything to handle inheritance in our ORM. 

We just need to note that the attributes of the super class must be protected and not private.

The subclass will include all these attributes and the relationships will also be included and mapped as it is specified before.

If the developer is able to respect all these constraints, we are ready to create our database and interact with it.
