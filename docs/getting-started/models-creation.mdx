# **Creating Models**

To create a model in EasyORM, you simply need to create a plain Java class that follows the convention of JavaBeans.

The only requirement when creating models is to respect the convention of JavaBeans:

- The class must have a default constructor with no parameters.
- Private attributes of the class (instance variables) must be accessed publicly through accessor methods built with "get" or "set" followed by the capitalized name of the attribute.
- The class must not be declared final.
- The class must be serializable to be able to save and restore the state of the instances of this class (although this is not required for EasyOrm).

By default, EasyORM will automatically map your Java class to a database table with the same name as the class. The first field of the class will be used as the primary key of the table.

With this convention, you can keep your classes simple and easy to read. But it stills the flexibility to customize the table name, primary key and columns as needed.

```js

public class User {
    private Long id;
    private String firstName;
    private String lastName;
    private Integer age;
    
	// Default constructor
	// getters and setters
}
```
