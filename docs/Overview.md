EasyORM is a powerful Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework that helps developers build applications that interact with databases. It can be used for small-scale applications with a few tables, as well as large-scale enterprise applications. EasyORM is influenced by other ORMs like [Hibernate](http://hibernate.org/orm/), [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/) and [Entity Framework](https://www.asp.net/entity-framework) .
